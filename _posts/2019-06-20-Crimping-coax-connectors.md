title: Crimping coax connectors
---

I used to really hate wiring up coax connectors. I'd decide I needed to wire up a lead for some purpose and order the plugs. They'd arrive
and then get put in a box somewhere never to see any cable. Soldering PL259 UHF plugs never seems to work. Although the centre pin is easy 
to solder, if you don't file it down it then sticks in the socket and forcing it apart breaks something. Then trying to solder the braid 
seems impossible. If you manage to apply enough heat to the plug's body to get a decent joint, it melts the dielectric and you get a short.

Because of all this I decided to use phono (RCA) sockets on all my homebrew QRP gear. But these aren't great either. They actually work fine
electrically for RF especially at QRP levels but the plugs have still given me grief. You have to file the plugs to take RG58 cable and 
then the plastic shroud doesn't stay on the plug and it's impossible to remove it from a tight socket (such as my phono-to-BNC adapters). 
But because I hated fitting UHF and BNC connectors they were the best option.

But I finally decided I wasn't happy with the phono plugs and decided to invest in a crimp tool.

I chose this [crimp tool](https://cpc.farnell.com/duratool/d03016/f-bnc-tnc-n-crimp-tool/dp/TL02031) from CPC:
![Crimp tool](https://cpc.farnell.com/productimages/standard/en_GB/TL0203106-40.jpg) specifically because it claimed to do
RG174 cable as well as RG58. I wanted to be able to wire connectors with the thinner cable as I like to experiment with portable and
SOTA antennas.
