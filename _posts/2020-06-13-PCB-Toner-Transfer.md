title:  PCB Toner Transfer

There are lots of ways to prototype with through hole components - dead bug, Manhattan, Veroboard etc. But it is much harder 
with surface mount. I have used adapter boards with SMD ICs and have used a tile scribe to cut tracks on copper clad board but this is not
practical with ICs or for circuits of any size. So I have started making my own PCBs.

I've been using Kicad's Eeschema for some time for drawing schematics and so it didn't take me too long to get up to speed with PCBNew
which is the Kicad PCB software. Considering it is free I am very impressed. But the layout needs to be transferred to the copper clad
board and etched. The easiest way is to directly transfer laser printer toner to the board and use this as the etch resist.

I was initially inspired by this youtube video showing how nail varnish remover can be used to transfer the toner. I tried this but all I
got was a big black smudge. My nail varnish remover (well my wife's) is 98% acetone and this dissolves the toner. The brand used in the
video has a long list of ingredients and it appears that alcohol is the other key ingredient.
