title:  RF Changeover

I've been playing about with simple transmitters and receivers. The former are easy - a crystal oscillator, PA and key shaping circuit.
But receivers are much harder so I've been using my existing Arduino based direct conversion receiver. This means I need a way to
switch the antenna between RX and TX so I've built an RF sensing changeover circuit.

This circuit is from the book QRP Basics (2nd Edition) by the late, and much missed, Rev George Dobbs G3RJV.
