title:  TGJ AVR Radio Library
published: true
---

I have various projects using AVR processors (ATTiny and ATMega) so there is a lot of similarity between the various source files. Rather than keep multiple copies of the same
code I have created [TARL](https://github.com/G4TGJ/TARL) - the TGJ AVR Radio Library. This is a set of source files for AVR processors that provide functionality of use in amateur radio applications, although
many of the files could also be used in non-radio systems.

They provide CAT control, display, EEPROM, I2C, LCD, millisecond timer, morse keyer, oscillator (si5351a), rotary control and serial support.

See [TARL documentation](https://g4tgj.github.io/TARLdocs) for how to use the library.
