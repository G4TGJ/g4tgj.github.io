title:  British Amber Ale

Amber beer is more of an American style (and Irish Red Ale is similar) but it has many similarities with British Bitter. I called this 
amber as it is darker and less bitter than the beers I normally brew. It's the first recipe I've put here as I was delighted with how 
nice it is, especially when served through a traditional beer engine.
Although I've called it British it is a mixture of British and Canadian malt and British and American hops. The yeast is distinctly 
British though (although via Oregon!).
